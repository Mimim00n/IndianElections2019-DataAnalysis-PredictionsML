    "<p> The 2019 Indian general election was held in seven phases from 11 April to 19 May 2019 to constitute the 17th Lok Sabha. The votes were counted, and the result was declared on 23 May. About 911 million people were eligible to vote, and voter turnout was over 67 percent â€“ the highest ever and the highest ever participation by women voters.\n",
    "The Bharatiya Janata Party won 303 seats, further increasing its substantial majority, and the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won 353 seats. The BJP won 37.36% of votes, while the NDA's combined ballot was 45% of the 60.37 crore votes that were polled. The Indian National Congress won just 52 seats, and the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance won 91. Other parties and their alliances won 98 seats. </p>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<p> In this notebook, I have used data visualization tools such as Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn to visualize how India's people voted during the 2019 elections. I have also experimented with Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbor machine learning models to make predictions. The models' hyperparameters were first tuned manually, and then GridSearchCV was used to find the most optimum results. I have also evaluated the performance metrics of these models and compared them with each other. </p>"
